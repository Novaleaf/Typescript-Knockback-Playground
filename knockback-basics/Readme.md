## about the "core" dir

this folder contains a physical copy of the "Novaleaf-Core-Libraries" project (a sibling of this one)

in visual studio, we do a copy during the pre-build step (via robocopy) 

- VS2012 prebuild executes the "sync-core.cmd" file
	- if you use linux, figure out some other way.

### this "core" folder is checked in, but keep in mind it's just a copy, and to modify it's contents you should edit the original!!!
